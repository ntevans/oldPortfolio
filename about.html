                <p>I am a 21-year-old who was born in Plano, TX and lived there for eight years until we moved to Austin, TX, where my family currently lives. Ever since a young age, I have always been very technologically savvy as I had spent a good amount of time and interest on computers. I wanted to learn everything this technology had to offer, and I would even take apart the old, broken down family computer just to see what went on inside. When I was a freshman in high school, and had saved up enough money, this curiosity led me to buy the best computer parts on a budget and build my very first desktop. I didn’t realize it at the time but building that computer would go on to spark my interest enough to make me want to enter a   career in computing.</p>

                <p>Around the same time that year, my older brother was touring colleges and went on a tour at Texas A&M. My parents had invited me to tag along and, after realizing that would mean I would not have to go to school that day, I eagerly accepted. After walking around the campus and learning about everything A&M had to offer, including the widely acclaimed engineering school, I had fallen in love. It was at this point I knew where and what I wanted to study when I went off to college, and I was going to work hard in high school to make sure that is where I ended up. In the rest of my time in high school, I built up a lot of academic skills through my AP and Dual-Credit courses as well as a lot of leadership skills through the leadership team in my school’s band program so that, when I was a senior, I felt ready for college.</p>

                <p>Due to the overly large numbers of engineers entering A&M, by the time I had received my acceptance letter, the program at College Station was full and I had to spend my first year studying the same content but at A&M’s Galveston campus. While it was discouraging that I did not get to study at College Station at first, I worked hard to make sure I got the major I wanted and ended my freshman year with a 3.64. This had granted me automatic acceptance as a Computer Engineer, and I would study at College Station starting the following school year. I am now currently a Junior and am continuing to work hard and maintain good grades while also being apart of organizations that I can serve, and lead in, like Aggie Transition Camps.  </p>
